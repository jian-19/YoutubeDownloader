YouTube Downloader is extremely simple program for downloading songs or playlists (in audio or video) from YouTube.

## Disclaimer
- It's build for testing purposes only. Use at your own risk. 
- Downloading copyrighted videos without permission is a criminal act.
- The software is build using [Pytube](https://pytube.io/en/latest/), [PySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [MoviePy](https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/).
- It will run only on Windows.
- The App will download only mp3 or mp4 files in the best possible quality!

## Installation
NO INSTALLATION required Just Download the [YouTube Downloader.exe](https://github.com/SimeonTsvetanov/YouTube-Downloader/blob/main/YouTube%20Downloader.exe) Application on your PC. 
- Bypass the Windows Security (It seems to have problem with programs ported with pyinstaller.)

```bash
If you select just one song, it will be saved in the same folder with the application.
If you select a playlist, it will be downloaded in a sub folder named after the playlist.
```
## Usage
```python
Download the app
Bypass the Windows Security as it's ported with pyinstaller (no way around it)
# Select what you need, fill the link and HIT Download!
# As long as the link is correct:
The program will download the selected Song/Playlist.
```
